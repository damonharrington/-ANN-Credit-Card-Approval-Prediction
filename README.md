Building an ANN model for Credit Card Approval Prediction
# Title: Credit Card Approval Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks

# Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting credit card approval decisions. The project aims to showcase how machine learning techniques can be applied to solve real-world classification problems in the financial sector.

# Features
- Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- Feature Engineering: Highlights any techniques used to transform raw data into meaningful features.
- Model Implementation: Uses an ANN built with [TensorFlow/Keras/PyTorch] (update based on the library used) for classification.
- Evaluation**: Provides performance metrics and visualizations to assess model accuracy.
